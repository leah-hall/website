      <h1>How It Was Made</h1>
      <p>This website was created with the help of ChatGPT! Here's how it happened:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Leah brainstormed ideas for her website.</li>
        <li>ChatGPT helped generate code snippets for the design and layout.</li>
        <li>Leah migrated her code to GitHub.</li>
        <li>Leah customized and added her unique touch on the platform Github!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We used basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring it to life.</p>
      <p> You can go to GitHub.com/login to sign up and program for yourself, for free!!</p>
      <p> Anyone veiwing this can go into "Style Code" to see the code for all the cool styling we did to make this website pretty!</p>
